# Client Menu

After being successfully installed, RealmJoin is automatically started on the user login and is permanently active in the background. It is represented with an ID card icon. Clicking on the icon opens up the RealmJoin client menu. It contains basic information in the lower part and several links in the upper part. These links are ordered in two different sections - **Web Links** and **Software Packages**.

**Web Links** contains customizable web links. For example, Google. When a user clicks the web link **Google**, RealmJoin opens the Google Search automatically.

Software Packages contain customizable software categories. For example, **Browser** contains links to Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. With a click on a link, RealmJoin starts automatically an installation or an updating process (if the software is already installed).

Furthermore, RealmJoin offers a remote function (**Start remote session**).

A further useful feature is **Sync this device:**

When you click **Sync this device** RealmJoin will install or update mandatory packages. Furthermore **Sync this device** helps to speed up background processes (e. g. waiting for new weblinks or waiting for an admin account).
