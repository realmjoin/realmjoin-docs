# Showing Notifications

With the help of the notification feature it is possible to notify users and clients very quickly. Whether it is general information or important issues.

This feature currently needs to be configured using [RealmJoin Classic](https://realmjoin-web.azurewebsites.net).&#x20;

### Notification example

Once you have created your notification, the target groups will receive a notification at the scheduled time. This notification appears on the desktop of a client.
