# Runbook Permissions

You can give RealmJoin Portal a JSON-based configuration to granularily define which runbooks can be used in your organization and by which operator. &#x20;

To delegate, which operators can trigger runbooks at all or which operators do have access to [User, Group and Device management](../user-group-device-management/), please see [Permissions](permission.md).&#x20;

Please see the article on [Runbook Permissions](../runbooks/runbook-permissions.md) in Process Automation for a detailed explanation how to create the JSON configuration needed.

This page implements a simple editor, able to do syntax checking for common JSON errors. It also allows to fold in / hide code for better visibility.
