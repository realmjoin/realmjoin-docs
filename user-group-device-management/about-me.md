"About me" allows users to quickly access links to resources they might need in a modern workplace environment, e.g.

* Microsoft's "My Applications" page to manage apps and services you have acces to.
* Access to Microsoft's "My Account page to manage authentication factors.

It also allows a user to quickly see his/her devices and groups.

As an administrator / operator it can show you currently activated directory roles:
