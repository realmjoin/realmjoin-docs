# Runbook Customizations

You can give RealmJoin Portal a JSON-based configuration to customize the runbooks behaviour and appeareance to your organizations needs.

Please see the article on [Runbook Customization](../runbooks/runbook-customization.md) under Process Automation for a detailed explanation how to create the JSON configuration needed.

This page implements a simple editor, able to do syntax checking for common JSON errors. It also allows to fold in / hide code for better visibility.
