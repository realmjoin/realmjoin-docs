# Groups

RealmJoin Portal uses naming prefixes to attribute functions to specific AzureAD groups. E.g. by default application assignment groups are prefixed with `app`, so that a group that will assign Google Chrome to users will be named `app - Google Chrome`.&#x20;

This page allows to define these prefixes and to map group name prefixes to descriptive titles which RealmJoin will use when refering to these groups.
