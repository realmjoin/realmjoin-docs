# Custom Roles

## Overview

**Custom Roles** is an optional feature in RealmJoin Portal. When enbled by glueckkanja's support, it allows you create additional RealmJoin internal roles. You can assign granular / atomic permissions to these roles and bind them to AzureAD groups or users.

Custom Roles are defined as JSON. The JSON editor included in RealmJoin Portal offers syntax checking and highlighting and will verify your definition against the Custom Roles JSON schema.&#x20;

### Using the editor

#### Syntax check / Errors

The editor will check the syntas as you type. If a syntax error is detected, an error message **View x errors** and bug icon will appear next to **Save.**

## Rules

A role is described as a pair of permissions and users and/or groups these permissions are given to.

Roles are listed as part of an array (list) under the keyword **Rules**.

Example set of rules:

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Name": "Default: Supporters can change primary user [27e589a7]",
      "Description": "Default rule to allow members of a Supporter group to change the primary user of RealmJoin joined devices. Please keep the ID that is included its name.",
      "Groups": [
