# Group Namespaces

RealmJoin Portal uses naming prefixes to attribute functions to specific Microsoft Entra groups. By default application assignment groups are prefixed with `app`, so that a group that will assign Google Chrome to users will be named `app - Google Chrome`.&#x20;

This page allows to define these prefixes and to map group name prefixes to descriptive titles which RealmJoin will use when referring to these groups. This will not rename the group itself - only their category.

The pre-filled group namespaces can be changed or additional namespaces can be added to suit company requirements.

For example, the above group namespaces will appear in the User Profile as shown:
