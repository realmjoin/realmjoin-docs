title: Report Application Registration
description: Generate and email a comprehensive Application Registration report
---

## Description
This runbook generates a report of all application registrations in Microsoft Entra ID and can optionally include deleted registrations.
It exports the results to CSV files and an Excel (xlsx) workbook and can send them via email.
The report files can also be uploaded to an Azure Storage Account, returning time-limited download links.
The ReportFileFormat parameter controls which file formats are generated and delivered (CSV only, CSV & XLSX, or XLSX only).
When the CSV attachments exceed the email size limit and "CSV & XLSX" is selected, the email falls back to the Excel workbook alone.
Use it for periodic inventory, review, and audit purposes.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings: a custom header image, a custom footer image (public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each), a custom footer link, and custom accent and text colors (6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`). When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. A branding image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or a color value that is not a valid hex color, never prevents the report email - the corresponding default is used instead.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for setup details.
