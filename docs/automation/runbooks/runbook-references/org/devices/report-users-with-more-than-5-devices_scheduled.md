title: Report Users With More Than 5-Devices (Scheduled)
description: Report users with more than five registered devices
---

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a scheduled runbook. It is designed to run on a recurring schedule rather than being triggered for a single object. See [Scheduling](../../../scheduling.md) for details on how to configure runbook schedules.
{% endhint %}

## Description
This runbook queries Entra ID devices and their registered users to identify users with more than five devices.
It outputs a summary table and can optionally send an email with the report attached as CSV files and/or as an Excel workbook (one worksheet for the summary, one for the details).
The detailed export lists each device with its object ID, Entra ID device ID and display name, and indicates whether the device is also present in Intune as a managed device and whether it is compliant (both highlighted green/red in the Excel workbook).
The report files can also be uploaded to an Azure Storage Account, returning time-limited download links.
The ReportFileFormat parameter controls which file formats are generated and delivered (CSV only, CSV & XLSX, or XLSX only).
When the CSV attachments exceed the email size limit and "CSV & XLSX" is selected, the email falls back to the Excel workbook alone.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings: a custom header image, a custom footer image (public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each), a custom footer link, and custom accent and text colors (6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`). When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. A branding image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or a color value that is not a valid hex color, never prevents the report email - the corresponding default is used instead.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for setup details.
