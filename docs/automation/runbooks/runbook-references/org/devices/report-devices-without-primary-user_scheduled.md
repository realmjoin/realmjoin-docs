title: Report Devices Without Primary User (Scheduled)
description: Reports all managed devices in Intune that do not have a primary user assigned.
---

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a scheduled runbook. It is designed to run on a recurring schedule rather than being triggered for a single object. See [Scheduling](../../../scheduling.md) for details on how to configure runbook schedules.
{% endhint %}

## Description
This script retrieves all managed devices from Intune, and filters out those without a primary user (userId).
The output is a formatted table showing Object ID, Device ID, Display Name, Operating System, and Last Sync Date/Time for each device without a primary user.
The report can be limited to specific platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS/iPadOS, Android, Other) via boolean parameters. By default, all platforms are included.

Optionally, the report can be sent via email with CSV and/or Excel (xlsx) attachments containing detailed device information.
The report files can also be uploaded to an Azure Storage Account, returning time-limited download links.
The ReportFileFormat parameter controls which file formats are generated and delivered (CSV only, CSV & XLSX, or XLSX only).
When the CSV attachment exceeds the email size limit and "CSV & XLSX" is selected, the email falls back to the Excel workbook alone.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings: a custom header image, a custom footer image (public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each), a custom footer link, and custom accent and text colors (6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`). When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. A branding image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or a color value that is not a valid hex color, never prevents the report email - the corresponding default is used instead.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for setup details.
