title: Report Stale Devices (Scheduled)
description: Scheduled report of stale devices based on last activity date and platform.
---

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a scheduled runbook. It is designed to run on a recurring schedule rather than being triggered for a single object. See [Scheduling](../../../scheduling.md) for details on how to configure runbook schedules.
{% endhint %}

## Description
Identifies and lists devices that haven't been active for a specified number of days.
Automatically sends a report via email with CSV and/or Excel (xlsx) attachments.
The report files can also be uploaded to an Azure Storage Account, returning time-limited download links.
The ReportFileFormat parameter controls which file formats are generated and delivered (CSV only, CSV & XLSX, or XLSX only).
When the CSV attachment exceeds the email size limit and "CSV & XLSX" is selected, the email falls back to the Excel workbook alone.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details.
