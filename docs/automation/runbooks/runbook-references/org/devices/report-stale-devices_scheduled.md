## Description
Identifies and lists devices that haven't been active for a specified number of days.
Automatically sends a report via email.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details.
