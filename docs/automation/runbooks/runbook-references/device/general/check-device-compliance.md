title: Check Device Compliance
description: Check the Intune compliance status of this device
---

## Description
Shows whether this device is compliant in Intune. The simple view lists the overall state and the names of the non-compliant policies; the detailed view also shows which settings fail and why. Nothing is changed on the device. The report can be sent by email.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details on all available settings.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings:

- **Header and footer image** – public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each
- **Footer link** – target of the footer image
- **Accent and text color** – 6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`

When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. An image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or an invalid color value, never prevents the report email – the corresponding default is used instead.

Setup instructions and image requirements: [Email branding](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings#email-branding-optional).
