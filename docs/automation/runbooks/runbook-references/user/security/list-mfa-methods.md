title: List MFA Methods
description: List the MFA and authentication methods of this user
---

## Description
Shows every authentication method registered for this user in Entra ID, including the phone numbers of phone-based methods. Phone numbers can be masked to their last four digits. Optionally the user gets an email that an administrator has looked at their methods. Nothing is changed.

## Privacy and audit

This runbook reads sensitive identity data: the registered MFA methods of a user, including phone numbers. Phone numbers are masked by default. Set `MaskPhoneNumbers` to `false` only when the full numbers are required for legitimate support purposes; the action is logged together with the caller name.

## Activate user notification

This runbook can optionally send a notification email to the target user informing them that their MFA methods were retrieved by an administrator. To enable this, you need to activate user notification in the runbook customization.

The json configuration for this is as follows:

```json
"rjgit-user_security_list-mfa-methods": {
    "parameters": {
        "UserName": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "NotifyUser": {
            "Default": true,
            "Hide": true
        },
        "MaskPhoneNumbers": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "EmailFrom": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "ServiceDeskDisplayName": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "ServiceDeskEmail": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "ServiceDeskPhone": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "ServiceDeskPortalUrl": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "ServiceDeskTicketUrl": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "LanguageOverride": {
            "Hide": true
        },
        "CallerName": {
            "Hide": true
        }
    }
}
```

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending a notification email is optional and only happens when `NotifyUser` is enabled. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details on all available settings.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings:

- **Header and footer image** – public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each
- **Footer link** – target of the footer image
- **Accent and text color** – 6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`

When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. An image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or an invalid color value, never prevents the report email – the corresponding default is used instead.
