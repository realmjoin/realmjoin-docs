# Data Export

RealmJoin introduces an export functionality which enables you to work with your tenant data outside of the portal.&#x20;

## General Exporting

You can query the User, Group, Device and Package tables for your requested data and generate an OpenXML file containing the queried data with all columns.&#x20;

Simply go to a table, perform your search and press the download button in the top right corner:

## Export Use Case: Software Report

You can query for specific software and packages in the [software report](https://portal.realmjoin.com/softwarereport/all) and get a resulting table of users or devices with the different installed versions.&#x20;

Clicking on an entry in the "Devices" or "Users" column will result in a pre-filtered table-view which can be easily exported via the export button shown in the screenshot above.&#x20;

This enables you to do evaluations on installed software and identify Devices and Users with outdated versions.&#x20;
