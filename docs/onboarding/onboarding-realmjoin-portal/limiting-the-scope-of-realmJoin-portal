# Limiting the scope of RealmJoin Portal

RealmJoin Portal supports Microsoft Entra ID Administrative Units (AU). 
You can read more about Microsoft Entra ID Administrative Units [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units).

## Restricted Management Administrative Unit

To hide/protect some sensitive groups from RealmJoin, you can create a restricted management administrative unit in Microsoft Entra ID. After creating that restricted AU, you can assign sensitive groups to that AU and "hide" these groups from RealmJoin Portal (and everbody using RealmJoin Portal).
This is a good idea for high-sensitive groups that you want to protect, e.g. groups used for granting permissions/roles or to exclude users from certain Conditional Access Policies etc.
Users and applications must explicitly be granted/added to the scope of the AU to be able to interact with groups that are "protected" by the restricted management AU.

To make use of restricted management administrative units, there are no settings needed in RealmJoin.

You can read more about Restricted management administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-restricted-management).
To create a restricted AU, you can follow Microsoft's guide [here] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage?tabs=admin-center
To add groups you want to protect to the restricted AU as well as administrators that you want to allow to interact with these groups, please see this guide [here] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-members-add?tabs=admin-center


## Assigning a dedicated Administrative Unit to RealmJoin Portal

To fully "encapsulate" RealmJoin Portal, you can create a dedicated AU (default non-restricted) and assign the RealmJoin Portal app to that AU.

As a result, RealmJoin Portal will create groups only in that specific AU - and is also only able to interact with groups that are specifically in scope of this AU.

To enable RealmJoin to use AUs, please follow these steps:
1. Create AU in Entra (default, not restricted)
2. In the AU, permanently assign the role "Group Administrator" to the RealmJoin Portal app (application ID: `b0130885-16be-4c6f-83de-5b1042b5d2e3`).
3. Add the MS Graph API permission "AdministrativeUnit.Read.All" (type "**Application**") to the RealmJoin Portal app (application ID: `b0130885-16be-4c6f-83de-5b1042b5d2e3`).
4. Especially if you already use RealmJoin Portal, move all groups that RealmJoin should be able to interact with to the scope of the AU.
5. Create a ticket with Realmjoin Support and provide the ObjectID of the AU you created.
6. Wait for verification from RealmJoin support.
7. Now you can safely remove the following application permissions from the RealmJoin Portal app (application ID: `b0130885-16be-4c6f-83de-5b1042b5d2e3`) as these are not AU-aware. Instead the Entra Role "Group Administrator" is used. Make sure that you add that role beforehand (Step 2).

To create an AU, you can follow Microsoft's guide [here] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage?tabs=admin-center
To add groups to the AU scope so that RealmJoin is still able to interact with these groups, please see this guide [here] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-members-add?tabs=admin-center
To assign roles with administrative unit scope,  please see this guide [here] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal?tabs=admin-center#assign-roles-with-administrative-unit-scope
