# Packaging Roles & Responsibilities

#### Package Maintenance Types

**Maintained Packages**

* **Regular Updates**: These packages are consistently monitored by the GK Packaging Factory.
* **Update Process**: After rigorous checks, updates are published in the store.
* **Support Options**: If updates are missing, customers can open a support ticket to address this.

**Unmaintained Packages**

* **Categorization**: Any package not marked as maintained falls into this category.
* **Update Requests**: Customers must submit a regular update request for non-maintained generic packages.
* **Cost**: Updates for generic packages are free of charge.

**Custom Packages**

* **Tailored Updates**: Custom package updates are created through specific requests from customers.
* **Pricing**: These updates incur charges, as they are personalized per customer needs.

**Responsibilities**

Maintained application packages will be updated once the vendor releases updates. The GK Packaging Factory does not monitor non-maintained applications. Customers are responsible for monitoring and request updates for all other applications themselves.
