# Process responsibilites

### Maintained vs. unmaintained vs. custom packages

* Maintained packages are regularly checked by the gk packaging factory. The updates will be published in the store after being checked and deployed. If an update of a packages marked as maintained is missing, customers may open a support ticket to bring it to attention. The gk packaging factory intends to create as many packages as maintained as possible.&#x20;
* Unmaintained packages are all packages not marked as maintained. If a customer requires an update of a non maintained generic package, a regular update request has to be created. Updates of generic packages will not be charged.&#x20;
* Custom package updates are exclusively created from a dedicated packaging request per customer and will be charged accordingly.&#x20;

### Responsibilities

The gk packaging factory does not monitor applications for possible vulnerabilities. Maintained application packages will be updated after the vendor publishes updates. For all other applications the customer has to monitor their software for updates.&#x20;
