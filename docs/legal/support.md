## Support

### Eligibility

Customers, who have an active subscription of RealmJoin are eligible for our support services. The support is included in the RealmJoin subscription fee.

### Scope

Our support services cover technical assistance for administrators:

* Technical questions about features of RealmJoin
* Support for incidents regarding RealmJoin
* Support for incidents regarding Software Packages built by the RealmJoin team
* Requests for Software Packages

### Access

You can access our support in the tab "Help" on our main product website ([https://www.realmjoin.com](https://www.realmjoin.com/)).

Using the support website will generate a ticket in our ticket system, which will be the basis for the support process. Communication will happen in written form via e-mail or web-interface of our ticket-system. Depending on the support case, our support-engineers may decide to offer Microsoft Teams meetings to work on issues together with customers.

### Language

Our engineers are happy to support you in these languages:

* English
* German (service level may be limited)

### Support hours

* Monday-Friday
* 08:00-18:00 CET / CEST
* Except from public holidays for Hesse / Germany, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve

### Support Response Time

`Typical < 4 hours for incidents`

The Support Response Time is defined as the duration between the report of an incident and the start of incident or problem handling through one of our support engineers. The response time is to be calculated within the [support hours](support.md#support-hours).

## Packaging Delivery Time

`Typical < 5 business days`

The Packaging Delivery Time starts with the arrival of the software package request. The Delivery Time is counted within the [support hours](support.md#support-hours) as the period during which an employee is actively working on a software package. The Delivery Time is paused in case of queries or similar to the customer. The end of the Delivery Time is reached when the software package is created or otherwise classified as fulfilled. If larger quantities of packaging requests (e.g. large lists during customer onboardings, mass release cycles) are received, the Delivery Time may no longer be met.

## Service level

### Service hours

Our service is operated 24x7

### Service availability

The service availability goal is 99.5%. It is calculated by using the following formula:&#x20;

`service availability` = (`service period` - `downtime`) / `service period`&#x20;

where

* `Service period` is the corresponding calendar month\
  and&#x20;
* `Downtime` is the accumulated amount of time where the main RealmJoin service is unavailable. The RealmJoin service is considered unavailable, when there is no connectivity between the RealmJoin service and the internet.

Service outages must be reported by customers to our support as soon as possible and at the latest within 24 hours after occurrence.

In the event of a reported service outage, affected customers are entitled to apply within one week for the following credits for the affected calendar month:

* service availability < 99.5% => 10%
* service availability < 99.0% => 25%
