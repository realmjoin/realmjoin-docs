# User Profile

![About Me - User](<../.gitbook/assets/image (196).png>)

The User Profile ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (303).png>) tab allows users to quickly access resources they may need in a modern workplace environment, e.g.

* Microsoft's "My Applications" page to manage apps and services you have access to
* Access to Microsoft's "My Account" page to manage authentication factors

It also allows a user to quickly see their devices and groups.

Administrators will also be able to view their directory roles:

![About me - Admin](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-07 about admin.png>)

Switching to the detailed view displays the [user object's details](user-list/user-details.md) page (elevated permission required).
